# AI-Medical-Report-Scanner
*A smart AI-powered medical report / scan analyzer*

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered medical scan / report analyzer aimed at automating and accelerating the analysis of medical reports or scans (e.g. lab reports, imaging reports) to help healthcare professionals get insights faster and more reliably.  

Features:  
- Upload medical reports or scans (PDF / image / other supported formats).  
- Automatic analysis using AI / ML models.  
- Generation of a summary: key findings, possible concerns, and recommendations.  
- (Optional) Suggest follow-up tests or advice based on analysis.  
- (Optional) Provide references / resources for further reading (medical literature, guidelines, etc.).  

The goal is to make medical report analysis more efficient — particularly helpful in clinics with high load or limited expert availability.

1. **Input Upload** — Users upload medical reports or scan images.  
2. **Data Extraction / Preprocessing** — The system extracts text or relevant data from the upload (e.g. parsing PDFs, reading image metadata, OCR if required).  
3. **AI/ML Analysis** — The core engine analyzes the extracted data using trained models or AI logic to interpret results.  
4. **Result Generation** — The system outputs a structured summary:  
   - Key findings / observations  
   - Potential concerns or red flags  
   - Suggested follow-up tests or actions  
   - (Optional) Lifestyle / care recommendations  
   - (Optional) Reference links or further reading  
5. **User Display** — The results are displayed in a clean, user-friendly interface (web or CLI), ready for interpretation or export.
